# odin-recipes
This is my first project in TOP, where I have to create a webstite to dislay a recipe. 

Currently I've learned to use the terminal to navigate files and use git. Although it's still quite difficult to use and cumbersome, I find it fun to use.

When I'm done with this project I should have ample understanding of how to use HTML to create the basic structre of a website.
